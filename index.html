 President's Welcome

         In the 1940s, I had witnessed that my parents and masters had cured or improved many illnesses and conditions, but those knowledge are still new to most Americans today. Why? The answer is --- most Americans, including the healthcare providers, do not aware of the true value of the Chinese Medical Dao. The Chinese Medical-Dao included, but is not limited to, the followi

         1)  The medical mainstream is the patients, but not the doctors.
         2)  The patients’ daily foods are useful medicines, as well as poisons.
         3)  Appropriate medical knowledge is the best tool for self-care.
         4)  Everyone has a natural healing power within his body.
         5)  The best way to heal a patient is to find out and follow his within natural healing power, instead of fighting against it. 
         6)  A healthcare provider should treat a patient holistically, rather than apply a single “tunnel vision” to diagnose and treat the symptoms of his disease or condition.
         7)  Comparing to drugs, natural medicines are much easier to be accepted properly by human body. However, it is the parents’ obligation to learn the advantages and the side effects of the foods, and pass it down to their children. 
         8)  When anyone is sick, one or more organs might need a break, such as “take a nap”, or even go for “hibernation” by itself. And, any inappropriate treatment could disturb the natural healing power within his body, and also caused severe damage as a result.



            In fact, based on the Traditional Chinese Medicine and my family’s trainings I am able to tell and prove that there are so many patients who were misdiagnosed and mistreated all the time, but doctors and patients are not even aware of it. For example, when you are driving a car on the highway and encounter with rush-hour you might not follow the speed-limit 40 to 75 mile-per-hour, and the highway patrol would not force you to do so either; but when you are sick your doctor most likely would push you to match the so-called normal reading. 

         In those Ruseto College’s programs, we provide in-depth explanations of the Chinese Medical-Dao, from the Tai-Ji theory, Yin-Yang Theory, Five-Element Theory, etc. to Feng-Shui and Fortune-Telling, to improvement or even cure most of the diseases.


        
looks good 

Sincerely,


Pao-Chin R. Huang
President of Ruseto College

  Vision, Purpose & Supports 

1) Vision 

         The name Ruseto means love, mercy, hope, peace, health, share and more; and the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) includes Acupuncture, Moxibustion, Cupping, Chinese natural medicines, Tuina, Qigong, Feng-shui, etc., which provides people with  more preventative healthcare options, as well as to cure illnesses actually, rather than just to treat the symptoms.

         Unfortunately, for centuries, people have been undergoing too many kinds of surgeries, which according to the TCM does not actually cure the root that have cause the ailments. Therefore, we need to educate the people to combine the TCM and Western Medicine together, to be able to keep them in good health and live a better life.

         Ruseto College began its operations in 1987 as the Ruseto Oriental Institute to educate the public. To better serve the society, in late 1991, the School applied for approval from the State of Colorado and was officially recognized in March, 1992. The school seeks to enroll more students and provides them with the excellent knowledge and skills to be able to carry out its goal --- love, mercy, hope, peace, health, share, and more, to be able to cut down medical expenses and keep people in good health worldwide.

2) Purpose 

         In addition to educate the students with the knowledge and techniques in healing by the Traditional Chinese Medicine, it is very important for the School to teach the students to share the patients with the skills of “How to keep the patients themselves in good health by applying common senses in daily life.” 

       As a co-owner of the School, I have been practicing the Traditional Chinese Medicine since I was a boy, so I have realized that most of the time the parents could take good  care of their children’s illnesses better than what the doctors could. 
           
       In fact, pretty often a child’s illness was cure on the way to see a doctor. How? This is what we need to share how to use common sense in healing. I used to say, “Medical sense or common sense, cure makes sense.”


3) Supports 

          Mr. and Mrs. Huang continue to publish newletters, books and websites (www.ruseto.com, www.ruseto.us, www.ruseto.net, and www.ruseto.org) to share their lifetime experience with both the students and the public; meanwhile, they get feedback from the students and the public, in order to improve the school regularly and continuously, as well as to make America a better place to live.

          You are welcome to join with Mr. Huangs and continue to run their world-reknown clinic called the Ruseto Center, (in US) which was established in 1986. They have treated thousands and thousands of patients from all different walks of life, including doctors, nurses, chiropractors, massage therapists, midwives, herbalists and acupuncturists. They continuously share their remarkable results and experience with the school, including its students and stakeholders.
